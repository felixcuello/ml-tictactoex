# Tic-Tac-Toe - Machine Learning

This is my approach to Reinforcement Learning. I have been reading a little about
Reinforcement Learning, and I wanted to make my own version of the algorithm in 
Elixir, because I've been working in this language lately.


## Installation

Just install/compile matrex, in my case I don't have BLAS installed, so I had to do:

```
MATREX_BLAS=noblas mix compile
```
